"""
Build the English PII eval dataset(s) for the OpenAI Privacy Filter eval.

Outputs two JSONL files under ../sessions-en/:
  1. pii-eval.jsonl        -- PRIMARY. Curated, synthetic, therapy-style snippets.
                              Authored by hand for the masterclass demo. Every entity
                              is gold-labeled against the model's 8 categories.
  2. pii-eval-ai4privacy.jsonl -- SECONDARY (optional, requires `datasets` + network).
                              A real slice of ai4privacy/pii-masking-300k (English),
                              label-mapped to the model's 8 categories. Generic
                              (non-therapy) content; kept as a real-data sanity check.

Each line in either file:
  {"text": "...", "spans": [{"start": int, "end": int, "type": "<one of 8>", "value": "..."}],
   "source": "curated-synthetic" | "ai4privacy-300k"}

The 8 model labels (openai/privacy-filter):
  private_person, private_address, private_email, private_phone,
  private_url, private_date, account_number, secret

# advancing a cursor so repeated values resolve left-to-right). This keeps the
